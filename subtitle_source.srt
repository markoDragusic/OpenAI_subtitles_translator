2
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:33,892
On February 8, 1807...

3
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,903
from daybreak to nightfall...

4
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,555
the battle of Eylau cost
Napoleon's France 10,000 dead.

5
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,205
His Majesty King Louis XVIII...

6
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,106
His Majesty

7
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,270
Louis XVIII...

8
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,900
took...no, reconquered,
make that reconquered...

9
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,969
reconquered His kingdom...

10
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,819
If only he understood!

11
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,760
You are in the office of
Mr. Derville, attorney at law!

12
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,349
It's burning, Hure!
Open the window!

13
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,181
Mr. Hure, you rascal!

14
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,550
No more snacks for you!

15
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,572
Stop all this chatter!

16
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,581
I asked for a cloth
to shield my hands.

17
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Why not gloves?

18
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,971
Calfskin? Pigskin?

19
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,812
The scarecrow, with
his hat screwed on!

20
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,478
He's coming!

21
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,794
Shut the window!
And your trap too!

22
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,670
But, sir...

23
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,565
Quiet, Mr. Simonnin!

24
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,353
Don't keep the others from working.

25
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,470
We base our case...

26
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,788
on the decree...

27
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,809
Issued June 17, 1816.

28
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,105
Can I see your employer today?

29
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,634
Mr. Derville is in court, sir.

30
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,637
Good evening, sir.
As you can see, it's dinnertime.

31
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,181
We're closing.
- When will Mr. Derville be back?

32
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,128
With Mr. Derville, you never
know. He's very busy.

33
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,878
State your case quickly,
and we can...

34
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,863
I need a long time
to explain my case.

35
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,705
And I'll explain it to
no one but Mr. Derville.

36
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,606
I've come here five times!

37
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,481
Sorry, sir, but there's the
possible and the impossible.

38
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's impossible to talk to
Mr. Derville if he's not here.

39
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,223
And Mr. Derville is not here.

40
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,799
He's busy until past midnight.

41
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,842
If you're strong enough
to return at 1:00 am...

42
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,778
Tonight at 1:00 am?

43
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,700
You got rid of him.

44
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,997
You have to take spectres
like him by surprise.

45
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,843
Quite a surprise,
a 1:00 am appointment.

46
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,706
I say he's an old servant
cheated of his pay.

47
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,907
A coachman, I'll bet.

48
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,925
Nagged by his wife and
despoiled by his children!

49
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,506
- It's a bet!
- Why a coachman?

50
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,800
By the odor, sir.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,610
- Didn't you notice?
- Perhaps.

52
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,913
A horsey smell, and then some!

53
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,984
Stronger than horse.

54
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,102
A coachman's stink!

55
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,762
But the bet's on!

56
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,143
Simonnin! Now what are you up to?

57
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,843
Sir? We need your name
for the appointment!

58
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,187
Chabert. Colonel Chabert.

59
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,100
See, he's a colonel!

60
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,846
The one who died at Eylau?

61
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,585
Godeschal, really!

62
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,500
Don't make tasteless jokes.

63
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,300
But I feel concerned.
I handled the Chabert estate...

64
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,494
for Attorney Roguin,
three or four years ago.

65
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,100
So he's a ghost?

66
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,630
He's neither ghost nor
Colonel Chabert. He's just mad.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,559
Godeschal's right.
He's crazy.

68
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,675
- Godeschal lost his bet.
- What do you mean?

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,644
A colonel's a horseman.
More coachman than servant.

70
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,400
Madam, the guests are here. The
Count says the concert's starting.

71
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm coming. Help me, Sophie.

72
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,335
Brady & Worms? You remembered?

73
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,100
I was in London and I thought...

74
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,554
He'll make a fine peer!

75
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,918
I haven't smoked one of
these since I left England.

76
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,700
You remembered the weakness
I confessed to you?

77
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,209
A trifle, sir!

78
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,004
Life in England is unrivaled,
but after a year

79
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,319
the London moneylenders
sucked our blood.

80
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,827
Emigration...how sad!

81
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,895
We were so short of funds.

82
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,257
How those people made us suffer!

83
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,659
Yet we do our best to imitate them.
- So we do.

84
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,381
This Chamber of Peers
you're so proud of...

85
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
imitates their House of Lords.

86
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,550
Same standards of birth and wealth.

87
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,069
It too is the way to
government service...to power!

88
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,850
You'll be neither lord nor
senator, my dear sir...

89
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,682
but a Peer of France.

90
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,003
May I take two?

91
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,570
The box is for you, my lord.

92
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,650
He's bribing me!

93
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,110
I already mention him to anyone
who has the King's ear.

94
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,676
Why waste your money?

95
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,953
The Peerage...

96
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,208
There'll be no trouble
slipping you in.

97
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,247
You're highly esteemed...
everywhere.

98
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,365
Esteemed...

99
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,482
but...

100
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,641
I'm already setting
up an entailment.

101
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,697
Who mentioned entailment?

102
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,886
We know your fortune could buy...

103
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,804
ten peerages.

104
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,544
My fortune is often confused
with that of my wife.

105
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,491
Countess Ferraud is irreproachable.

106
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,152
A good wife and mother.

107
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,900
I owe her a lot.

108
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,912
It's nothing to do
with her personally.

109
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,929
We know how attached
you are to each other.

110
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,000
It's what she represents.

111
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,507
The principle she
represents, her past.

112
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,370
Her fortune amassed
under Napoleon.

113
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,700
You know our friends...

114
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,879
suffered under that tyrant...

115
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,400
While that lovely woman partied...

116
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,100
danced with marshals he promoted...

117
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,034
who bowed to their Little Corporal.

118
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,293
His Majesty resents all that.

119
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,821
It'll be forgotten.
Everything is.

120
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,054
But we must act now.

121
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,243
In six months the
chamber will be full.

122
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,800
Baron Courcelle has three
daughters to marry off...

123
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,688
and one foot in the grave.

124
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,469
It's time to go calling
with gifts of sweets.

125
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,385
Don't miss the boat, Ferraud.
Make your move.

126
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,400
When powerful interests vie,
you can't put one on ice...

127
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,936
and serve the other.

128
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,698
You have to cut.

129
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,712
It should be surgical.

130
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,855
Surgical.

131
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,741
An excision.

132
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,200
Look at Talleyrand.

133
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,999
His wife was an idiot.
Goodbye, Madam.

134
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Look at the monster Bonaparte.

135
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,221
Josephine was sterile.

136
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,207
Out with her.

137
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,668
It seems a huge step.

138
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The first six weeks are difficult.

139
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,600
Then one morning you wake up...

140
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,419
and realize it's passed.

141
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,236
Like an illness.

142
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,620
I must see to my other guests.

143
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,428
Excuse me.

144
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,391
Of course, my dear man.

145
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,296
But...think over our chat.

146
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Ambition...

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,761
or the pillow?

148
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,484
It's up to you.

149
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,072
All this music is a bore.

150
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,448
It was a great success.

151
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,048
Indeed.

152
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,230
You seem doubtful.

153
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,770
A great success.

154
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,801
The wine was scalding.

155
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,953
Too hot. For my taste, anyway.

156
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,662
Lucienne served it too soon.

157
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,763
I warned her, but she's unruly.

158
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,343
I'll speak to her.

159
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,916
The musicians cost a lot of money.

160
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,568
I'll put them away, Sophie.

161
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,097
- Yes, Madam.
- You go to bed.

162
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,196
Goodnight, Madam.

163
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,130
They were good, and
we agreed to the price.

164
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,449
The musicians.

165
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,563
How do you know they were good?

166
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,315
I hired them for your pleasure...

167
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,501
and you vanished with
that old miser Chamblin.

168
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,489
Vanished?

169
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,648
I was in the next room.

170
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,654
Music can be heard
from room to room.

171
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,443
So can Chamblin.

172
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,742
He annoyed everyone.

173
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,722
Was what you had to say...

174
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,883
so important?

175
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,451
So secret?

176
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,323
The peerage as usual, I suppose?

177
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,915
The peerage...

178
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,492
and many other things.

179
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,142
What, for example?

180
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,547
What other things?

181
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,120
Sophie is really a nitwit!

182
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,377
I ought to get her back down here.

183
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,847
She forgot to remove my necklace.

184
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,697
Don't disturb her.

185
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,856
Well?

186
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,542
Aside from the peerage...

187
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,788
what did you gentlemen talk about?

188
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,888
The weather...

189
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,420
Hunting.

190
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,120
And me?

191
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,343
You spoke about me?

192
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,695
Yes.

193
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,226
You. Me.

194
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,614
The Empire.

195
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,776
Surgery.

196
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,181
You forgot your keys, boss?

197
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,388
Oh, it's you.

198
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,741
You said 1:00 am.

199
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,032
I know, but...

200
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,771
This way.

201
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,674
The porter let you come in?

202
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,719
I mentioned Derville.

203
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,872
Sit down.

204
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,930
Attorney Derville
will be back soon.

205
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,477
I'll be patient.

206
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,380
Did you think we were joking...

207
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,529
when we stipulated this
amazing time...

208
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,081
to see Mr. Derville?

209
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,289
This is his normal routine.

210
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,298
Each evening he's out
cultivating people.

211
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,000
From 10:00 am to 2:00 pm
he sees clients.

212
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,732
The rest of the day he's
in court or at meetings.

213
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,776
He has only the night to
plan his case strategies.

214
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,289
He's immensely intelligent.

215
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,966
He can do ten things at once.

216
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,707
He'll sit there, dining, reading
letters and newspapers...

217
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,246
while I outline the
next day's cases.

218
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,100
Never gets mixed up!

219
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,542
Everything is absorbed,
analyzed, filed.

220
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,887
He makes it a point of honor
never to lose a case.

221
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,226
Any case!

222
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,506
Sir, whom have I the honor
of speaking to?

223
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,633
Colonel Chabert.

224
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,964
I'm listening.

225
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,009
I wish no one but you
to know my situation.

226
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,100
You may go, Boucard.

227
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,950
- But...
- No. Sleep well.

228
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,957
Yes, sir. It's all ready...

229
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,249
All right, I'll tend to it.
Good night.

230
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,675
I'm all yours, sir.

231
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,522
Don't mind if I read.
I'm listening carefully.

232
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,716
Late at night every minute counts.

233
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,813
Please be precise and brief.
Get right to the point.

234
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,355
If questions are needed,
I'll ask them.

235
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,070
All right. I'm Chabert.

236
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,545
Colonel.

237
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,547
I commanded a calvary
regiment at Eylau...

238
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,482
where I died on February 8, 1807.

239
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,100
I was a key figure
in Murat's charge...

240
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
that won the battle.

241
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,315
I can even say I saved the day.

242
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,685
I crossed the Russian lines.

243
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,300
Three lines reformed behind me
as we rejoined the Emperor...

244
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,908
after massacring the Russians.

245
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,011
Two officers...

246
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,542
giants...attacked me.

247
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,441
A saber gashed open my head.

248
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,521
I fell off my horse.

249
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,687
You fell off your horse.

250
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
Murat flew to my aid...

251
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,858
and 2000 riders passed
over my body...no less!

252
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,745
The earth shook.
I felt it in my gut.

253
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,955
2000!

254
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,488
A charge no one
will ever see again.

255
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,896
The cannons...

256
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,022
the screams...

257
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,264
The battle shook my body...

258
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,802
until I died.

259
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,651
It's all in "French Victories and
Conquests from 1792 to 1815".

260
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,988
It must be in your library.

261
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,016
The Emperor was told of my death.

262
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,552
He said, as you'll see on page 206:

263
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,431
"So my poor Chabert is dead!"

264
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,413
The Emperor!

265
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,300
Two surgeons,
who didn't bother to listen

266
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,801
to my heart, signed the
death certificate.

267
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,300
And there I was...a corpse!

268
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,609
Did you know I'm
Countess Ferraud's lawyer?

269
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,606
Yes, I know.

270
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,790
I came to you because all
the other lawyers think I'm mad.

271
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,452
But yes, I know.

272
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,266
You interrupted.

273
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,499
Page 206,
"Victories and Conquests".

274
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,127
"So my poor Chabert is dead.

275
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,053
Two surgeons. And there
I was, a corpse!"

276
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,085
My wounds had put me
in a cataleptic state.

277
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,215
That's why I was inert...

278
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,980
when, as usual in wartime...

279
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,848
the burial detail stripped me...

280
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,729
and threw me naked
into the mass grave.

281
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,428
The pit...

282
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,267
How was I to breathe?

283
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,000
No air.

284
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,593
My ears rang.

285
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,778
And my head...

286
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,596
There's no word to
describe the pain.

287
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,522
But I can describe death.

288
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,612
Death is red, then blue.

289
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,906
And it is cold.

290
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,523
Above all...

291
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,276
It's silent.

292
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,042
Silent...

293
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,286
At first, you seem to
hear a running brook:

294
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,150
My comrades' dying
breath and moans.

295
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,329
Some weep, oh, yes.

296
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,729
Bones crack...

297
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,819
Teeth grind...Oh, Lord!

298
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,924
And then...

299
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,397
And then...

300
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,106
the slightest sigh echoes...

301
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,446
echoes...

302
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,930
And then...

303
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,388
Death is the silence of death.

304
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,497
Then suddenly...

305
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,200
a thump.

306
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,084
Another and then another.

307
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,165
My heart began to beat again.

308
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I moved the mass smothering me...

309
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,688
opening a breach big
as a rabbit hole.

310
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,064
Air flowed down on me. Air!

311
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,561
The cold burned me like salt.

312
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,795
To suffer is, after all, to live.

313
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,237
A woman saw the snow flutter
when I coughed.

314
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,450
She called her husband...

315
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,145
a fool who knelt
and crossed himself.

316
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,258
She hauled me out
of the pit to their hut.

317
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,764
Six months between life and death.

318
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,535
They took me to the
Heilsberg hospital.

319
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,908
My memory returned
in bits and pieces.

320
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,100
My name, my past life...

321
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,762
my colonel's rank.

322
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,732
Luckily...

323
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,382
Dr. Sparchmann, a surgeon...

324
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,676
took an interest in my case.

325
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,312
Sparchmann, Heinrich...

326
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,488
Neukapelle Strasse, Heilsberg.

327
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,908
He took me to his lawyer,
a Prussian, like him.

328
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,851
So I got my story on paper,
with oaths and signatures...

329
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,100
medical descriptions
of my wounds...

330
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,000
testimony from my rescuers.

331
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,277
It's all there, in Heilsberg.

332
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,795
I was to get a copy,
but war resumed.

333
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,102
I had to flee. A city each week.

334
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,891
Those people are no
worse than others.

335
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,249
No better, either.

336
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,826
I was French, an enemy,
but they fed me.

337
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,824
When they heard "Colonel"...

338
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,032
they laughed.

339
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,477
Often it got me a kick in the ass.

340
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,184
Or the madhouse.

341
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,416
The madhouse...

342
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,735
the worst thing that
can happen to a man.

343
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,852
The buckets of water...

344
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,619
your arms tied behind your back...

345
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,080
the cudgel...

346
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,633
the food they toss you.

347
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,238
And as a madman...

348
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,755
you live with the mad.

349
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,740
Cottbus...

350
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,716
Dresden...

351
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,437
Gera.

352
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,378
The asylum in Gera!

353
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,189
After all that,
I can't stand my name.

354
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,052
Yet I'm claiming it.

355
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,725
I'd like not to be me...

356
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,449
Yet here I am.

357
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,132
The general blindness mystifies me.

358
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,910
Knock at any attorney's door...

359
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,400
In rags, sir...

360
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,848
a knock brings dogs and policemen!

361
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,312
How does one bring a lawsuit...

362
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,616
without cash on the table?

363
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,949
You should know that.

364
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,475
A lawsuit against whom?
The Russian Army?

365
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,089
Against my wife!

366
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,215
You mentioned her name before.

367
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,582
Isn't Countess Ferraud my wife?

368
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,840
She has a large fortune.

369
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,850
It came from me.

370
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,381
From me...alone.

371
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,438
I found her here, in Paris.

372
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,469
I call. She has me thrown out.

373
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,730
I write to her.

374
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,249
Boutin, my only friend...

375
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,580
my orderly in my days of glory.

376
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,799
Boutin...

377
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,953
who alone recognized me
in a Strasbourg jail...

378
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,448
from which we escaped together.

379
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,439
You wrote to Countess Ferraud?

380
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,600
Four times from Prussia,
twice since my return.

381
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,206
I'd say, maybe they
were lost in the mail.

382
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,181
Boutin handed her the last one.

383
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,583
She tore it up without reading it.

384
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,447
Without reading it.
She's killing me again!

385
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,758
Killing me!

386
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,207
Calm yourself.

387
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,437
I earned it for her...

388
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,816
I bought her a house.

389
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,384
It cost me over 100,000 francs.

390
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,517
With paintings...

391
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,895
furnishings, everything!

392
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,206
Maybe at first she didn't
recognize my deathly pallor.

393
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,228
But since then?

394
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,338
I was buried under the dead, sir.

395
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,200
Now they're burying me
under the living...

396
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,976
Under papers, stamps...

397
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,355
Lawyers see worse things
than writers can invent.

398
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,302
I've seen wills burned...

399
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
Mothers despoil their
lawful children...

400
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,515
on behalf of those
bred in adultery.

401
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Wives use their husbands'
love to murder them...

402
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,699
or drive them mad,
so as to live with their lovers.

403
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,682
I've seen ugly quarrels
over still-warm bodies.

404
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,536
I've seen crimes, sir...
Crimes...

405
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,626
that human justice is
powerless to punish.

406
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,847
Our offices are sewers
that no one can clean.

407
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,762
Tonight I won 300 francs at cards.

408
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,486
I'll contribute half
to your resurrection.

409
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,607
Tomorrow see my
chief clerk, Boucard.

410
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,200
Tell him your story, with
dates, names, addresses.

411
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,272
Add any details you
think of overnight.

412
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,138
As for me...

413
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,600
I have five more hours' work to do.

414
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,833
Forgive me. Shall I see you out?

415
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,117
Are those all people
you're defending?

416
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,032
The files?

417
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,385
I attack people too.

418
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,737
It reminds me of
the Genoa cemetary.

419
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,831
Graves on the hillside...

420
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,302
dangling red flowers.

421
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,313
The Genoa cemetary...

422
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,728
Is my wife there?

423
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,614
This way.

424
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,109
- You know her?
- Of course.

425
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,525
Has she changed?

426
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,674
Changed? I wouldn't know, sir.

427
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,470
But today, as a woman,
Countess Ferraud is...

428
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,051
The word will come to me:

429
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,183
"Superb".

430
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,202
Superb.

431
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,491
That's her, all right.

432
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,609
You'll recover your wealth, Colonel.
- "Colonel"!

433
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,063
But the paperwork, the mail...
It all takes time.

434
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,129
Here's an advance.

435
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,704
Until you win, you'll get a stipend
so you can live decently.

436
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,704
It's a difficult case.

437
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,839
Even if I get the papers
you say are in Heilsberg...

438
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,988
It's no certainty.

439
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,823
It will be slow.
It goes before three courts.

440
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,823
Leave Countess Ferraud alone.

441
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,327
You still love her?

442
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,300
Love her?

443
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,100
No.

444
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yes.

445
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,834
I want her, that's for sure.

446
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,958
But such disgust too!

447
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,300
Forget her as a woman.

448
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,005
From now on she's merely...

449
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,286
the opposing party, the enemy.

450
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,533
- Very well.
- We'll play dead.

451
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,637
No one can do that
better than I, sir.

452
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,899
Even if I lose my money...

453
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,825
I won't regret it.

454
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,483
I'll have seen the most
skilled actor of our time.

455
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,930
Third wound in the back:
Austerlitz.

456
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,500
Nine inches, from navel
to left breast: lena.

457
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,281
Fourth wound...
- He contradicts himself?

458
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,532
Not once in three weeks.
Not one mistake.

459
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,495
Ask about yesterday's weather,
he's mute.

460
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,873
But a wound 15 year ago?
He's ruler-precise.

461
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,443
I'm waiting for his papers.

462
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,892
It'll be a long wait.

463
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,275
Does Sprachmann even exist?

464
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,330
Or the Heilsberg lawyer?

465
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
Or even his accomplice, Boutin?

466
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,455
- Meaning?
- It's memorized, like a role.

467
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,400
He's been repeating it for
ten years, revising, ruminating.

468
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,300
- And his birthplace?
- He's a foundling.

469
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,310
There must be some record.

470
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,477
- And his mother's name?
- Unknown.

471
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,617
He gives her name as
Augustine or Augusta.

472
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,924
Sometimes Marguerite.

473
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,000
That's how it is!
Memory's like that!

474
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,717
Mine, at any rate!

475
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,404
It's all dead!

476
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,300
Except some spots
glow like embers...

477
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,105
and they can die too.

478
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,432
You'd understand if you saw
the wound on my head.

479
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,595
That wound...his head...

480
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,192
- You saw it?
- No, that's like a shrine.

481
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,300
His hat's nailed over it.

482
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,200
When he took it off to mop his neck,
he had a black stocking cap under it.

483
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,613
Move, Simonnin!

484
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,533
The same one he wore
under his helmet.

485
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,543
- And the inventory, Godeschal?
- Nothing new.

486
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,755
None of the valuables he describes
appear in the estate inventory.

487
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,668
- Really?
- Yes. Ask Desroches.

488
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,200
No tapestries,
no silver punch bowl.

489
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,903
The Girodet painting?

490
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,677
No trace of it,
or of the display cabinet...

491
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,103
for the coin collection
he boasted of.

492
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,971
I keep telling you:

493
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,599
A pretty cabinet,
with eight flat drawers...

494
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,694
velvet-lined, with holes
for the antique coins.

495
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,200
Silver, bronze, all rarities.

496
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,333
12 of them:
Greek, Roman, some even older.

497
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,973
Spoils of war.
Wiesbach Palace.

498
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,874
I repeat sir,
the estate lists no such...

499
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,967
Your millions come down
to a few hundred thousand...

500
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,400
perhaps less.

501
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,000
I keep on reciting...

502
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,127
I made a list of my goods
before I went off to war.

503
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,689
I have your list.

504
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,913
But compared with the one
your wife gave to Rougin...

505
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,915
The official estate inventory
after your...death...

506
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,607
My death!

507
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,131
They don't match.

508
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,204
It's terrifying.

509
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,812
It's magnificent.

510
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,750
Your wife robbed you like a bandit,
which you can forgive.

511
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,105
But she also robbed the State,
which never forgives.

512
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,829
We have a good way
to bring her to her knees.

513
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,017
You don't matter.
It's a case of tax fraud.

514
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,391
If she contests it,
we'll call witnesses.

515
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,200
- What witnesses?
- Boutin, for one.

516
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,600
He knew you in your days of glory.

517
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,658
He saw the painting, the punch
bowl, perhaps even the money...

518
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,062
Boutin saw it all.
He even got a bit of it.

519
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,567
But I won't bring him into court.

520
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,873
Really?

521
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,347
He's wanted.

522
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,024
A Strasbourg lawman.

523
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,855
- No.
- Yes.

524
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,895
They threatened me
with the madhouse.

525
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,422
All right, no Boutin.

526
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,007
We'll canvas your fellow soldiers.

527
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,910
Fishing's poor in that stream.
Too many dead.

528
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,101
Too many dead.

529
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,714
Russia devoured them all.

530
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,562
All switch...Right attacks left!

531
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,631
Bounce on those thighs!

532
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,703
Torso springs straight
on the thighs!

533
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,769
You're on horseback, gentlemen.

534
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,424
Don't forget that!

535
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,708
Straighten your backs!

536
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,755
You asshole!

537
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,836
Fined for obscenity!

538
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,647
- He broke my nose.
- Good for him!

539
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,142
In combat, it'd be your skull!

540
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,400
Son of a bitch!

541
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,538
Stop the fighting!

542
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,031
Sergeant, the rules!

543
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,577
No swearing, no blasphemy.

544
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,481
No insults.

545
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,200
No talk of the Bourbons
or their cronies!

546
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,683
We honor the Emperor
and await his son.

547
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,670
Violators will be fined.

548
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,847
He buys two quarts!

549
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,548
Crépin, gather the rods.

550
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,166
The rest can take a break.

551
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,560
In silence!

552
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,773
Who's this clown?

553
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,095
Mr. Derville.

554
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,051
In formation, gentlemen!

555
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,726
Combat positions!

556
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,362
Attack!

557
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,606
The papers, Colonel.

558
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,805
The papers from Germany.

559
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,001
- Hello, Colonel.
- Hello, sir.

560
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,742
How'd you find me?

561
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,059
We had you followed.

562
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,580
Is there someplace
quiet we can talk?

563
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,634
Of course.

564
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,376
You live here?

565
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,563
I wanted to hide
this poverty from you.

566
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,128
What a stench!

567
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,200
The bears sleep there.

568
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,965
- Are they yours?
- Boutin's.

569
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,200
They dance, coins drop, so we eat.

570
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,888
Speaking of which,
I'm embarrassed, but...

571
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,000
You want to talk about money too?

572
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,444
Frankly, yes.
We met two months ago.

573
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,200
You get five francs a day.

574
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,100
- Isn't Boucard paying you?
- Yes.

575
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,000
Yes, in cash every Friday.

576
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,290
He makes me sign a receipt.

577
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,893
Well, then?

578
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,618
That's Boutin, my orderly.

579
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,374
Is there no better lodging
in Paris? The stink is awful!

580
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,003
A place suiting your
rank of Colonel...

581
00:44:16,065 --> 00:44:17,918
Grand Officer of
the Legion of Honor?

582
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,792
No tailors, wig makers, cobblers?

583
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,412
You think I'm wasting my money?

584
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,832
So people can say,
"Chabert spends it...

585
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,864
on wine, gambling, women"?

586
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,366
- I only mean...
- When I'm rich, you'll get double.

587
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,682
Tenfold, a hundredfold!

588
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,715
It's too sloppy, Sergeant!

589
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,787
Landrevec, you look ridiculous!

590
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,164
Guard your thigh and head!

591
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,779
Saber combat is a science.

592
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,858
For the calvary,
the science of survival.

593
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,081
Survival is a soldier's duty.

594
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,576
"Reports of the Imperial Army."

595
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,486
I know them by heart up
to the battle of Eylau.

596
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,151
Up to my death.

597
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,200
Then they went it alone.

598
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,787
"By heart."
You admit that openly?

599
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,595
Why not?

600
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,317
You can say it to me...

601
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,356
but suppose...

602
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,858
Come, we'll be better off outside.

603
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,241
Suppose...

604
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,600
our opponent heard
that naive admission.

605
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,400
They'd say,
"The imposter memorized it all!"

606
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:33,062
That stink of bear!
- The wind blows it back.

607
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,000
Don't worry. They're chained.

608
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,117
Brie's the youngest.
I gave him to Boutin.

609
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,237
Sit down.

610
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,587
You have the papers?

611
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,802
All of them:
Surgeon, lawyer, hospital.

612
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,300
Sit down.

613
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,100
<i>We'll run 'em through the ribs</i>

614
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
<i>The ribs, tra-la-la-la-la</i>

615
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,844
<i>Run 'em through the ribs</i>

616
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,100
<i>Oh, how we shall laugh!</i>

617
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,961
<i>We'll run 'em through the ribs
Rat-a-tat-tat</i>

618
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,946
<i>Tra-la-la-la-la</i>

619
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,643
We're training the
sons of war dead.

620
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,224
So that the truth
is re-established.

621
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,500
Two days ago I despaired of
recovering even my name.

622
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,122
I was going to
stand in the street...

623
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,600
and howl for justice.

624
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,647
Now justice is done.

625
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,343
The papers say I'm Chabert.

626
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,792
I'll be awarded the rest.

627
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,539
- The rest?
- Yes.

628
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,701
My money. My rank. My wife.

629
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,954
Chabert. Colonel Chabert.
Good man.

630
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,989
You had no children.

631
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,119
They've had two together.

632
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,939
You only reported your survival
after their marriage.

633
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,639
Morally, your position is weak.

634
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,824
You face a woman who no longer
loves you, and her husband.

635
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,739
Powerful people who can
influence the courts.

636
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,000
- Justice is justice, no?
- Yes, but merely justice.

637
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,047
Let us compromise with it.

638
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,861
Compromise is the key.

639
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,268
- You claimed we'd win.
- I still do.

640
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,112
But in 5, 10,
20 years of bickering...

641
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,300
We baffle them,
so we're strong now.

642
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
It could go quickly, out of court.

643
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,200
- And honor?
- Honor is living openly and well.

644
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,795
I'll get a settlement of 400,000,
maybe more.

645
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,400
We'll offer to annul
your marriage...

646
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,411
If the Ferrauds help annul
your death certificate.

647
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,887
Alive again, you'll retire
with a general's rank.

648
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,200
Every penniless country girl...

649
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,082
will be at your feet.

650
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,783
But I will have sold my girl...

651
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:48,195
My wife.

652
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,958
Derville!

653
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,274
Good morning, my dear Derville.

654
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,300
Madam, I haven't much time...

655
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,910
and we have a serious
matter to discuss.

656
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,406
I'm crushed!
My husband's away.

657
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,940
I'm delighted. He'd have been
crushed to hear us.

658
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,925
Delbecq says you can manage
your own affairs well.

659
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,826
I'll call Delbecq.

660
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,848
I know his skill and
devotion to you...

661
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,520
But...believe me,
we're better off alone.

662
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,946
I do declare, your face and
voice are frightening.

663
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,476
A few words will turn
you serious, Madam.

664
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,604
Chabert is alive.

665
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,463
I've seen him. I know him.

666
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,411
Stop clowning.
What won't you think of!

667
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,515
Must I show you the papers proving
your first husband's survival?

668
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,462
It's a lie.

669
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,117
This so-called Colonel Chabert
must be an imposter, an ex-convict.

670
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,423
Can Chabert return to life?

671
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,723
Bonaparte sent an aide
to inform me...

672
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,473
of his death, and I was
awarded 3000 francs...

673
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,946
in pension, as his widow.
By the Chamber.

674
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,751
I rightly rejected all the
Chaberts who turned up...

675
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,474
as I will those to come.

676
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,697
Luckily, we're alone.
We can tell lies.

677
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,357
I wouldn't take on a fraud.

678
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,204
You know that.

679
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,511
You're representing this impostor?

680
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,899
I pitied him, and he has
so much proof.

681
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,872
I'm sure I can easily
disprove his "proofs".

682
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,785
No. They are strong enough
to cancel the death certificate.

683
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,543
Lose on that, and
you lose the rest.

684
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,441
Whose cause are you defending?

685
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,152
His...or mine?

686
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,163
I'm still your lawyer,
as I am Colonel Chabert's.

687
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,016
Do you think I want
to lose a client...

688
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,679
as valuable as you?

689
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,068
You're not listening.
- I am.

690
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,172
I can hardly wait to hear the rest.

691
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,100
I'm in a position to know
how large your fortune is.

692
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,853
It's colossal.

693
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,612
- Is that a reproach?
- Not at all.

694
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,040
I admire your ability
to make it grow.

695
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,100
But it began as Colonel Chabert's.

696
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,795
He left me far less
than I have now!

697
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,713
Calm yourself, please.

698
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,334
On the one hand, this fortune.

699
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,619
On the other hand, the poverty
of a man you refuse to aid.

700
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,591
Aid means acknowledgment!

701
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,207
Reducing him to beggary
will harm your reputation.

702
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,729
Then let's go to court!

703
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,939
I may lose 100,000
to your "Mr. Chabert"...

704
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,410
but my second marriage will be
legalized because of my children.

705
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,774
How do we know how the courts
will see a matter of the heart?

706
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,200
We have a mother
and her children...

707
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,722
versus an old man forced into
poverty and misfortune...

708
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,701
by fate, but also by you.

709
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,733
Judges are rarely young men
in the prime of life.

710
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,395
They'll see a lost,
wrinkled Chabert...

711
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,991
unable to find another
wife, and then...

712
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,593
you'd go to court,
but courts are public.

713
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,933
Places where secrets
are unveiled, proclaimed.

714
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,072
Your opponent is never mute.

715
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,869
A good lawyer can paint
you in odious colors...

716
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,866
and arouse...

717
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,291
an unexpected enemy.

718
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,571
I'm giving you a friendly
warning of the risk.

719
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,457
An unexpected enemy?

720
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,821
Your husband, Count Ferraud.

721
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,450
Count Ferraud prizes me.

722
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,396
- I'm the mother of his children...
- I'm a lawyer!

723
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,924
Don't talk such nonsense to a
man who knows the human heart.

724
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,196
Right now, I'm sure he loves you...

725
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,425
and has no wish to break
the ties that bind you.

726
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,302
Imagine him learning...

727
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,838
that his marriage
could be annulled.

728
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,881
He'd refuse.

729
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,485
No, Madam.

730
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,682
He'd need...strong reasons.

731
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,383
Isn't the strongest that,
with his marriage annulled...

732
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,638
he'd see no obstacle
to a new union?

733
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,805
I know French peers anxious
to marry off a daughter.

734
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,040
A royal decree...

735
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,819
could make the
peerage hereditary...

736
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,364
from father-in-law to son-in-law.

737
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,613
I'll never have any lawyer
but you, Derville.

738
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,698
Thank you, Countess.

739
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,990
What should I do?

740
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,915
Compromise. Negotiate.

741
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,022
That's always the way.

742
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,737
The Colonel...

743
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,128
Do you think he still loves me?

744
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,550
I can't imagine
he'd feel otherwise.

745
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,130
I'll send you an agreement...

746
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,152
acceptable to both parties.

747
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,415
You could have
your first meeting...

748
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,908
in a few days.

749
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,006
Trying to get sick?

750
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,200
- I slept badly.
- When's the meeting?

751
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,780
- Noon.
- You've time for a nap.

752
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,566
No.

753
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,787
For a woman. Really!

754
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,939
Especially your own.

755
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,929
They're only in case
I push on to Pomains.

756
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,304
There's no public coach,
but a lone rider's not safe.

757
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,633
Army deserters.

758
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,918
Keep an eye on Gilbert
in my absence.

759
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,104
He's hovering around Julie.

760
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So?

761
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,015
He's promised to Mathilde.

762
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,300
If he toys with a rival,
we may lose him and Mathilde.

763
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,819
What do you care?

764
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,493
I'm attached to him.
He knows horses.

765
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,479
What'll you do in Pomains?

766
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,830
More questions.

767
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,381
I heard that the Marquis
de Termesson's sister lives there.

768
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,962
In Pomains.

769
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,349
She'll sell the land bordering
my estate at the right price.

770
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,869
You said you were too poor
for any extravagance.

771
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,400
A good reason to drive a hard
bargain with the old witch.

772
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,203
Unless you lend me
the money I need.

773
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,067
I said no.

774
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,241
Never mind, Berry!

775
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,198
I'd only need 80,000.
That's nothing to you.

776
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,789
For me, it completes
my entailment...

777
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,584
without resorting to usurers.

778
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,805
I'm going to Groslay to set
the new farm rents.

779
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,170
- You'd lend that sum to anyone.
- I'm short of cash.

780
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,224
It all went into
the sugar refinery.

781
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,839
The sugar refinery!
Progress!

782
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,200
A fortune built on beets.

783
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,275
I didn't dictate our
marriage contract.

784
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,593
Your demands are
working against you...

785
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,816
and I manage my
fortune as I see fit.

786
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,062
I gave you a name.

787
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,069
And a rank.

788
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,149
- That's worth...
- Two children?

789
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,183
You have them.

790
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,056
Including a son
which is beyond price.

791
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,946
You never listen to me.
Or to Delbecq.

792
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,100
Only to the old fogies
in the peerage...

793
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,092
scheming for riches.

794
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,645
Don't go away angry.

795
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,567
I'll talk to Delbecq,
see what we can do.

796
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
40,000...

797
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,006
Be cautious.

798
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,300
You're seeing Derville today?

799
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,900
Just for a few signatures.

800
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,374
Berry, the Count is leaving.

801
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,573
- This dress, Madam?
- Yes, put it on the bed.

802
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:00,852
You'll never see her again...

803
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,200
our maid Julie.

804
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,956
I'm firing her.

805
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,893
You value Gilbert,
I value Mathilde.

806
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,436
And you.

807
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,567
Hurry! My appointment's in an hour.

808
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,721
I saw her!
She's coming! Chief!

809
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,200
She's here!

810
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,695
Hush, Simonnin!

811
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,500
Not so loud! Scat!

812
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,700
You'll wear a wig, not a hat!
And your Legion of Honor.

813
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,700
You must be impressive,
very impressive!

814
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,821
Mr. Derville is in
his office, Countess.

815
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,369
She visits Count Ferraud
on odd days...

816
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,677
and Colonel Chabert on even ones!

817
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,911
On leap years
she evens the "count"!

818
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,300
I bet a box of candy...

819
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,946
they kiss and make up.
- Nonsense!

820
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,779
She's a man-eating tiger.
She'll gobble up Chabert!

821
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,543
I didn't know if you wanted
to see Count Chabert...

822
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,585
so I separated you.

823
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,488
I'm grateful for the courtesy.

824
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,300
I'll be in the next room...

825
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,019
where Boucard will note
the parties' reactions.

826
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Mr. Chabert has agreed to
stay in the adjoining room.

827
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:04,282
I can read aloud a proposal
you can both hear.

828
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,992
I'll sound you out
for your opinions.

829
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,108
Let's begin, Derville.

830
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,788
Very well, Madam.

831
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,700
"It is agreed this day...

832
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,908
in the office of Mr. Derville...

833
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,417
attorney, and in
his presence, between...

834
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,149
on the one side, Mr. Chabert...

835
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,978
Amédée Jacques Hyacinthe...

836
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,923
Count...

837
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,971
Brigadier General, Grand Officer
of the Legion of Honor...

838
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,429
domiciled in Pre Saint Gervais...

839
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,205
and, on the other side...

840
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,916
Madam Chapotel, Rose...

841
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,200
Marie Cecile...

842
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,007
wife of...
- Skip the preliminaries!

843
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,200
They explain your
respective positions.

844
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,468
- The terms!
- I'm coming to them.

845
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,100
"In Article One
of this agreement...

846
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,347
you recognize before me
and my head clerk...

847
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,310
Amédée Boucard..."

848
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,797
- Hello, Boucard.
- My respects, Countess.

849
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,599
"You agree that the aforesaid
person, whose identity is given...

850
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,110
in an ordinance held by
Alexandre Crottat...

851
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,100
attorney succeeding to Roguin...

852
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:30,255
is your first husband,
Colonel Chabert.

853
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,285
The said Colonel and
Count Chabert agrees...

854
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,078
first, to renounce
all rights this bestows.

855
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,904
Second, to begin proceedings
to dissolve the marriage...

856
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,687
in the month after his
death certificate is annulled...

857
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,385
provided that the
financial clauses are fulfilled.

858
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,682
You are given two choices:

859
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,300
An annual payment
of 30,000 francs...

860
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,256
recorded in the public register..."

861
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,933
Which involves some publicity.

862
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,880
No, our agreement must
be kept secret!

863
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,105
Quite right, Madam.

864
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,389
"The alternative...

865
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,324
closes the case with the payment...

866
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,032
the payment of a flat...

867
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,232
and final sum of...

868
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,859
420,000 francs."

869
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,547
That's absurd!
420,000 is absurd!

870
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,034
It's far too much!
The sum's preposterous!

871
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,432
400,000 is the minimum.

872
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,811
Be reasonable, Derville.

873
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,295
Does your money come so easily?

874
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,743
150,000, and that's a lot.

875
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,100
- 400,000.
- No!

876
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,836
400,000, no!

877
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:56,665
180,000.

878
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,795
But, Madam...

879
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,200
What do you expect?

880
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,397
I reject these indecent claims.

881
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,418
But I want no lawsuit.

882
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,677
I know what I want.

883
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,677
For the Colonel to stay dead?

884
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,300
Then I'll go to court!
I prefer that!

885
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,135
A lawsuit!
I'm no pushover!

886
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,308
400,000 is fraud!
It's madness!

887
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,364
Then let's go to court! I'll tell
how I left you over a million!

888
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,766
And how you haggle over my revival.

889
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,515
That man is not Colonel Chabert.

890
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,334
I'll prove our intimacy.

891
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,843
Describe the secret marks
on your body.

892
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,268
You want a suit?
So do I!

893
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,147
She was in a brothel!

894
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,825
The first time I had her...

895
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,142
I bet 100 francs in
a lottery and won her!

896
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,369
Don't rush off!
I've a lot to say!

897
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,213
I want 420,000!
And my rights!

898
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,694
By law, I've two days a month
of conjugal rights.

899
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,714
Now I want them!
Two days a month.

900
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,295
Two days. Two nights.

901
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,554
He's insane!

902
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,217
He should be locked up,
put in a straitjacket!

903
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,001
Two days, two nights,
like old times, Countess!

904
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Like the brothel!

905
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,877
Courtrooms love to hear
about sluts!|We'll see if I'm mad!

906
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,700
It's all over. Get to work.
Not a word about this!

907
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,951
Your identity's proven.
She blanched when she saw you.

908
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,857
Her pallor is worth an affidavit.
Boucard, the Colonel's hat.

909
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,961
- A madhouse. I'll kill her.
- You'll be caught and guillotined.

910
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,731
I'll take this medal and have
your name engraved on it.

911
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,985
Forget about killing
a woman you might miss.

912
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,951
That would be an
unforgivable error.

913
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,600
Put on your hat.

914
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,100
I'm not mad, you know.
It's criminal to say so!

915
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,740
Go home. I'll file the suit.
We'll do fine.

916
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,462
Our terms stand.
I want to see you happy.

917
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,721
Avoid traps. Agree to nothing,
sign nothing without asking me.

918
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,348
Be wary. We have weapons
and your wife knows it.

919
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,989
She knows it.

920
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,081
Come.

921
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,491
Please.
Why hold back?

922
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,936
Sir, I recognized you.

923
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,856
Please understand.

924
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,295
How could I admit
to my mistakes...

925
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,687
confess in front of
all those people?

926
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,158
I did get your letters...

927
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,931
but a year after your death.

928
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,818
I'd already remarried.
A month before.

929
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,635
You were my sole support.

930
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,895
I'd only been tolerated
on your account.

931
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,416
Without you, I was nobody again.

932
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,365
Then I met Ferraud.
He's been good to me.

933
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,647
Very good.

934
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:27,842
You got my letters.

935
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But soiled, and scarcely legible.

936
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:35,657
I feared I was being tricked
by a false Chabert.

937
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,015
Then...

938
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,239
a new family relieved my mourning.

939
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,116
You mourned me?

940
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:57,071
Where are you taking me?

941
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,471
To my country house in Groslay.

942
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,905
if you have the time to spare,
we can decide what course to take.

943
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,733
It's my private retreat.

944
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,801
In Paris we know too many people.

945
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,467
We're always entertaining.

946
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,525
Count Ferraud's colleagues.

947
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,906
He's on the Council of State.

948
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,832
Prominent men, members of
the Academy, judges.

949
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,621
No one comes here.
It's peaceful.

950
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,999
Count Ferraud...
likes to rest here.

951
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,736
The children love the place.

952
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,727
Count Ferraud designed
the gardens himself.

953
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,961
- Don't you ever say "my husband"?
- May I?

954
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:27,840
Delbecq, my steward.
Knows the price of everything!

955
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,200
Colonel Chabert, the hero of...
You know.

956
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,003
I need a few moments
to give orders.

957
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,727
I want the children here
early tommorrow.

958
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,829
It's been arranged, Madam.
And the Colonel?

959
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,065
It's trickier than I expected.

960
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,163
Like it?

961
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,051
Yes.

962
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,133
It's beautiful.

963
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,200
Just what I'd have given you
when I made general.

964
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,916
I'll sell it.

965
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,578
How do I get the 400,000
Derville's asking for?

966
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,182
Come. I'll show you your room.

967
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,302
You were sure I'd come here?

968
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,917
I hoped we'd already have
reached an agreement.

969
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Alas.

970
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,955
Why "alas"?
It's easy to agree.

971
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,202
I doubted the whole world, Rose...
You, myself.

972
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,758
Be reasonable!

973
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,683
You're still so lovely. Reasonable?
Aren't we man and wife?

974
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,560
Even if the law's on your side,
I'm no longer yours.

975
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,141
My heart's changed.

976
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,554
You mustn't love me like your wife.

977
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,423
I love someone else.

978
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:59,313
Life tore us apart,
the harm's already done.

979
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,954
Why reopen old wounds?

980
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,368
I appeal to you.

981
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,581
Lieutenant.

982
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,174
You can take me by force.

983
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:12,897
But I love Ferraud...

984
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,503
and my children.

985
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,926
When Fate made me a widow...

986
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,960
I wasn't yet a mother.

987
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,070
So the dead are wrong to reappear.

988
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,757
I'll summon you
when dinner's ready.

989
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,416
Nothing but my share.

990
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,722
And not even all of that.

991
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,080
You were part of it...

992
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,584
and I lost you.

993
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,724
You know how our luck
changes in life.

994
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,200
Misfortunes occur, houses burn,
sickness comes...

995
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,750
People die.

996
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,547
It's everyone's lot.

997
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,742
My lot is that I'm not dead.

998
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,772
I've had sickness, misfortune.

999
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,377
But my house didn't burn. It was
stolen, and I nabbed the thief!

1000
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,491
I just want half
of what was in it.

1001
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,309
In the house.

1002
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,345
The solution's simple.

1003
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,081
When...the bad news came...

1004
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,851
I had to obey the law.

1005
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,500
- So I went to a lawyer...
- Roguin?

1006
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:04,100
Yes. I drew up an
inventory of your estate.

1007
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,689
Life doesn't change
as much as you say.

1008
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,100
Countess Chabert,
Countess Ferraud.

1009
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,518
Scratch the polish and
you find Rose Chapotel...

1010
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,742
who sells a ten-cent object
for three francs.

1011
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,101
The inventory...

1012
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,394
was checked, line by line.

1013
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,984
Everything of value has vanished.

1014
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,596
The tapestries...

1015
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,375
the gold coins, the silver...

1016
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,955
Josephine's punch bowl.

1017
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,317
400,000, no!

1018
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,544
How much?

1019
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,217
180,000?

1020
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,129
No.

1021
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,815
300,000.

1022
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,558
It's too much.

1023
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,460
250,000.

1024
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,900
I can't rob my children
without further thought.

1025
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,272
Ferraud's ambitious.
I help him the best I can.

1026
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,307
If you fleece me too...

1027
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:27,992
200,000?

1028
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,069
Well, let's see.
What do I need?

1029
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,955
A small house in the heartland.
It's Boutin's region.

1030
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,759
He'll give fencing lessons.

1031
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,492
Rabbits, chickens...

1032
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,542
fishing, firewood for winter...

1033
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,049
a newspaper and my tobacco.

1034
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,721
On 1000 a month
I'll live like a prince.

1035
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,249
Who can live on 1000 a month?

1036
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,317
I haven't always had
a hundredth of that.

1037
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,441
Ten francs?
No, not always.

1038
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,420
Ten francs?
Can you really?

1039
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,677
Ten francs for a whole month?

1040
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,696
No, you can't.
But you survive.

1041
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,981
And regret it.

1042
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,032
You can very well regret living.

1043
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,016
My God...

1044
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,308
How you've changed.

1045
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,768
You too.

1046
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:11,988
Changed.

1047
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:15,871
No more laughter?

1048
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,759
With Ferraud...
Do you laugh?

1049
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,540
No.

1050
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,705
I'm sure you don't,
not even in bed.

1051
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,646
I bet you play the Duchess...

1052
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,203
with that dummy.

1053
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,515
Still snickering.

1054
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,558
You only know how to roughhouse
women or laugh at them.

1055
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I won't give in.

1056
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,540
Ferraud and you, two hounds
in a pack biting at opposite sides.

1057
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,703
Normally he'd protect
me from you...

1058
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,752
but when he hears you're back
I'll read my doom in his eyes.

1059
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,886
But you keep telling me
you two are in love.

1060
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,676
I am, yes!

1061
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,339
He still pretends to be.

1062
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,698
But women can read men
like an open book.

1063
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,431
An open book.

1064
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,293
My God!

1065
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,291
I'm so frightened!

1066
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,700
Madam, the children have arrived.

1067
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,075
I'll be right down.

1068
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,355
The old man didn't
sleep in his bed.

1069
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,701
I saw him go out.
His bed was still made.

1070
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:03,806
All right.

1071
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,408
He slept on top of it.

1072
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,913
Here you are, Delbecq!

1073
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,869
- What do I do about the Colonel?
- We'll pay him off.

1074
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,601
No. It's not the money.
That can be arranged.

1075
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,334
He's frightening.

1076
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,530
It's a mask.
I'm terrified.

1077
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,548
He yields, looks away,
I think I've won.

1078
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,307
Then he looks back, and
I see nothing's settled.

1079
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,709
I find him affable.

1080
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,011
Believe me, he's an ogre.

1081
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,900
If he recovers his name
and title, what then?

1082
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,100
- If I may ask, has he given you up?
- Yes. Today.

1083
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,769
Then we've won.

1084
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,300
No, it's a drunkard's oath.

1085
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,582
On a whim, or bad advice,
or his lust for women.

1086
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,617
I saw the heron fly off.

1087
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,044
I saw the nest.

1088
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,585
Three eggs.

1089
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,341
Eggs.

1090
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,624
What comes out may not be a bird.
It could be...

1091
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,716
A snake, a turtle...

1092
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,530
A dragon.

1093
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,524
A dragon with two heads.

1094
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,695
Take the children inside!
Mathilde!

1095
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,490
But, Madam...
- Take them inside. It's still too cold.

1096
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,300
In Egypt there are big lizards
called crocodiles...

1097
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:34,824
that also come out of eggs.

1098
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,756
Hurry!

1099
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,684
You frighten them.

1100
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,655
What's wrong?

1101
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,307
It's nothing.

1102
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,952
Weeping again?

1103
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,678
I can see you are.

1104
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:13,816
Delbecq said I was rash to bring you
here without telling my husband.

1105
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,270
If the Count learns,
he may cast me off.

1106
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,016
I won't tell him.

1107
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,387
But my children saw you!

1108
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,086
They'll talk.

1109
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,894
They'll be taken from me.

1110
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,453
I couldn't survive that.

1111
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,807
I'd kill myself!

1112
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,998
For me, it's settled.
I thought it over last night.

1113
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,877
I've made my decision.
Don't worry.

1114
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,639
Give me 12,000 francs a year...

1115
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,466
plus a coach and horse,
and that's that.

1116
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,992
You mean...

1117
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,291
You'll hear no more of
your dead husband.

1118
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,000
But...

1119
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,493
you could change your mind...

1120
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,296
tomorrow, or an hour from now.

1121
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,935
Is that how you see me?

1122
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,687
No.

1123
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,411
I trust your generosity.

1124
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,457
But your decision forces you
into a vow of silence.

1125
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,218
A permanent lie.

1126
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:21,941
You're better off dead.

1127
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,763
Death is gentler than you think.

1128
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,877
They'll want proof
of your good will.

1129
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,351
I can't live waiting for you
to reappear on some pretext.

1130
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,669
You're not wicked,
but you're so capricious.

1131
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,848
Even before, you were thought
of as weird, remember?

1132
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:51,206
Your head wound must
have accentuated that.

1133
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:57,867
My word's not enough?

1134
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,391
You want forms, stamps,
seals, official edicts?

1135
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,339
Then let's go back to Derville.

1136
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,340
Why Derville?

1137
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,359
If you agree, there's a lawyer
here. We can settle it today.

1138
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,084
Fine, so we'll use this lawyer.

1139
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,233
He's very convenient, isn't he?

1140
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,601
The silver?
Yes, she always did that.

1141
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,695
The Countess.
Always.

1142
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:49,229
"Before you die,
make silver shine", they say.

1143
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,701
"A token of friendship. Josephine."

1144
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:03,603
The Empress.
Her punch bowl.

1145
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,565
A wedding gift.

1146
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,744
Where's the Countess?

1147
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,839
In her office, end of the hall.

1148
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,883
- But her lawyer's with her.
- I know. He's here for me.

1149
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,050
This is...the cosigner.

1150
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,909
Sir, the Countess
has requested me...

1151
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,857
to read you this agreement...

1152
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,558
- It's already drawn up?
- Lawyers know how.

1153
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,880
All right.
You may read it.

1154
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,887
"On this June 14, 1817...

1155
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,300
was made before Mr. Sarrazin,
attorney in Montmorency...

1156
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:09,763
with Marie Gratien and Leon Delbecq
acting as witnesses...

1157
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,415
the following agreement:

1158
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,751
Countess Ferraud,
born Rose Chapotel...

1159
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,646
agrees to an annual payment
to the cosigner...

1160
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,084
until the death of either...

1161
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,652
the sum of 12,000 francs...

1162
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
in twelve equal parts
of 1000 francs...

1163
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:31,411
to be paid on the
first day of each month.

1164
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:36,387
In addition to this sum,
Attorney Derville will receive...

1165
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,195
a single flat fee of 2000 francs.

1166
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,692
In return for this...

1167
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,061
the cosigner agrees
to renounce forever...

1168
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,592
the usurped identity
of Colonel Chabert...

1169
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:55,769
which he admits
he took fraudulently..."

1170
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,455
How could you imagine
I'd sign such a paper?

1171
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,990
I wanted to see how far
this sham would go.

1172
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,725
I didn't think you could
stoop so low.

1173
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,925
- I told you I'd given up.
- On the money, yes.

1174
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,987
But your name's a threat. I need
to be sure. What's in a name?

1175
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,807
My name, Madam, is my honor.

1176
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,874
Honor!
What honor?

1177
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,300
That of being a
burden to society...

1178
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,484
a madman who can't manage
his life without help?

1179
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,930
Madam...

1180
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,013
I thank the fate
that separated us.

1181
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,354
I won't curse you.
I despise you.

1182
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,735
I don't even want revenge.

1183
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,014
I want nothing from her.

1184
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:59,892
She can believe my word's worth
more than any lawyer's scribble.

1185
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,478
I'll never claim the name
I glorified and she dishonors.

1186
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Don't touch me!

1187
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:10,643
Please understand.
Without the children...

1188
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,090
Without the children?

1189
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,281
You'd be dead.

1190
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,071
"She'd have loved to see me foam and
scream the insults she deserved...

1191
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,890
to give her a pretext
to call me mad...

1192
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,188
so she could have me
locked away at Charenton.

1193
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:05,959
Dear Mr. Derville...

1194
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,423
I've suddenly contracted
an incurable ailment:

1195
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:12,587
Disgust with humanity.

1196
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,455
You could scarcely measure
my contempt for the world...

1197
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,228
and the public life most men value.

1198
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,061
Except for Boutin and you.

1199
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,986
You listened and helped me
more than a son might have done.

1200
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:33,450
Now I'm returning underground.

1201
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,866
I may not have shown you
my gratitude for your kindness...

1202
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
but I hold it
prominently in my heart.

1203
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:45,485
It reigns there, fully intact.

1204
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:49,446
But what more can
the unfortunate do?

1205
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,004
They love, and that's all.

1206
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:59,062
Good men like you put fine thoughts
above fine clothes.

1207
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,357
I fear no man's scorn.

1208
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,833
Farewell, and thank you."

1209
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,345
Death can strike a person
without dissolving the family.

1210
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,400
It can even enlarge the group...

1211
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,701
by bringing forth
unknown relatives.

1212
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:34,461
But that's not your case.

1213
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,350
All right.

1214
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,645
Derville?

1215
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,978
You didn't say you were coming.

1216
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,880
I didn't come to see you, Madam.

1217
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,214
Not you alone, in any case.

1218
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:00,200
You wished to see me?
- Yes, he's surprised me!

1219
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:03,420
The latest list of
new peers, Count.

1220
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,171
I know.

1221
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,905
Four idiots who passed me by.

1222
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,465
They're young, Count.
They'll be there a long time.

1223
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,200
Gonpalet! He grew rich
swindling under Napoleon...

1224
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:19,100
he's led a life of debauchery.
Mistresses, bastards...

1225
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,305
But skill in corruption, wealth,
and a knowledge of the law...

1226
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,846
- You're here for that?
- Indirectly, yes.

1227
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,622
A possible connection.

1228
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,809
A surprise.

1229
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,164
A visit I received that
you weren't told about...

1230
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,269
though it offers us a way...

1231
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:54,575
You're being mysterious.
What's this about?

1232
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:58,951
A way to do what?

1233
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,380
A way, perhaps...

1234
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,530
to reverse those
unjust nominations.

1235
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,341
- I don't see...
- The peerage, Count.

1236
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,982
Chabert is alive.
I've seen him.

1237
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,797
Chabert?
Your first husband?

1238
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,927
The dead have come back to life.

1239
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,325
That's impossible!

1240
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,585
He came to see me. It's him.
There's a mass of proof.

1241
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:50,752
Now's the time to decide, Armand.

1242
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,320
If you drag me into court...

1243
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,826
they'll have to declare him alive.

1244
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,007
He's dropped his claims...

1245
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,713
but this frees you from the chains
of marriage. Isn't that right?

1246
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,419
It's true that no one in France
may have two wives...

1247
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:09,953
or two husbands.

1248
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,190
I mean, officially.

1249
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,488
Incredible!
You hid all this from me?

1250
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,437
For how many days or
weeks have you lied?

1251
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,610
Lied?

1252
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,217
Why lied?

1253
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,154
I fought. Your raging desire
to crawl toward the Throne.

1254
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,259
The peerage!
What misery it put me through!

1255
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,829
All those smiles for people
we both despised.

1256
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,996
Those concerts, suppers, meetings.

1257
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:52,276
Each one left you
more distant from me.

1258
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,169
The blame in your eyes...

1259
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:00,843
the cold courtesy toward me,
the obstacle to your ambition.

1260
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,129
Without my money...

1261
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,010
Countess...

1262
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,367
Count...

1263
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,852
I am at your disposal
at all times.

1264
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,125
Good day, Sister.

1265
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,513
Your protegé is in
the arcade today.

1266
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,699
- Is he settling in?
- Well, he's very docile.

1267
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,280
Thank you, Sister.

1268
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,525
Colonel Chabert, you look
like a mere lieutenant.

1269
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:47,120
No.

1270
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,897
Not Chabert. Hyacinthe.
Old Man Hyacinthe.

1271
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Number 164, room 7.

1272
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:01,903
I brought you some country cheese.

1273
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:08,707
- And white bread!
- White? Say!

1274
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:31,044
The Countess, your wife,
is retiring to the country.

1275
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,613
She still has a future.

1276
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:36,885
White bread.

1277
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,688
Nice!

1278
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,323
Count Ferraud hints he'll wed...

1279
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,089
the oldest Courcelle girl.

1280
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,528
That will make him a Peer of
France within two years.

1281
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:13,063
I also brought a
flask of red wine.

1282
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,728
You saw the condemned man?

1283
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,198
This wine...

1284
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:24,494
is not as strong as last time.

1285
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,431
And tobacco.

1286
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,621
Good tobacco.

1287
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,853
Chabert!

1288
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,721
But I can describe Death.

1289
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:26,740
Death is red, then blue.

1290
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,855
And then it's cold.

1291
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:34,793
Above all, it's silent.

1292
01:43:39,002 --> 01:43:42,392
